        //A mediator pattern encapsulates how objects interact and communicate with each other.This pattern promotes the loose coupling of objects to avoid an ugly dependency graph.
        //The mediator pattern enables objects to avoid referring directly to each other by encapsulating communication in a central mediator object.

        //Mediator Pattern Characteristics

        //Mediator: define communication between colleagues

        //Concrete Mediator: implement communication between colleagues

        //Colleague: communicate only with the mediator

        //Concrete Colleague: receive a message from the mediator
